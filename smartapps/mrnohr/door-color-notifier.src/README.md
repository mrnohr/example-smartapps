I have 2 color-control light bulbs downstairs that I use as indicators when a door is open upstairs (like a kid's
bedroom door). This adds on to the functionality in other apps in that when the door opens it changes a bulb a color,
and then when it closes, the bulb gets reset back to soft white or turns off. It checks the status of a 2nd bulb to know
what to do.
