The kids like Christmas lights going in their room as they fall asleep during the holidays. This sets a timer to turn
the lights off after a certain number of minutes. However, to keep the kids in bed, it also turns off the lights if the
kids get up and open the door.

This 'advanced' version uses a Minimote to turn on the lights and set the timer. The top-left button turns on the
lights. The top-right (and bottom-right) turns them off. The bottom-right turns on the light and starts the timer.
