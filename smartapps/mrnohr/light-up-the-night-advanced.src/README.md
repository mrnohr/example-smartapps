Turns on lights when it gets dark, and off when it gets light. Uses an sensor for illuminance like the Aeon Multisensor.
It also turns on the lights at a given time, and off at a different time. Finally, it has a delay, so the lights don't
go on and off if the light level is right on the threshold.
